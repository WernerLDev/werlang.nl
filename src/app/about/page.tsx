          <h3>My background</h3>

          <p>
            My name is Werner and I am a software developer from the
            Netherlands. I have a bachelor of engineering with a specialisation
            in interactive media products.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey on the world wide web started when I was still a
            teenager. I wanted to learn how to build websites so I started
            experimenting with HTML/CSS and later also PHP. Some time after that
            Flash and Actionscript3.0 came around and I started playing around
            with that as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember 2advanced.com from back in the day? That is the kind of
            stuff I admired. I wanted to create cool stuff for the web. I have
            spent a lot of my free time making senseless experiments just for
            fun.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have studied Media technology at the Hogeschool Utrecht where I
            graduated in 2013. I have done my graduation internship in Beijing,
            China. Here I created a mobile app that can be used to practice
            mandarin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides my bachelor I have also spent 1 year in Sweden where I
            followed a 1 year datascience program at the university of Sk√∂vde.
          </p>
          <p>
            After graduation I have worked for digital agencies, consultancy
            firms and large enterprises. At those organisations I have gained
            experience with several languages and frameworks but C#/.NET and
            React/TypeScript became my prefered tools for building modern web
            applications.
